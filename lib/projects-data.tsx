  overview: "I independently designed, built, and deployed this mobile-first workforce management app for Props Factory to modernize daily operations and eliminate paper-based workflows. Tailored for a diverse and largely non-technical workforce, the app allows employees to check in/out securely using GPS and facial recognition, view payslips, submit claims and overtime, access project assignments, and manage their profiles. Real-time notifications, streamlined approvals, and role-based access controls help align workers and supervisors on key tasks. The system is powered by Supabase (PostgreSQL) for structured data and Google Cloud for serverless backend logic, media storage, and auto-deploy infrastructure. Firebase Cloud Messaging enables instant alerts, while cloud functions and RPCs handle critical logic like payroll calculations and request status updates. The result is a highly optimized, maintainable app aligned with real-world workflows and tested directly with field staff.",

            I was tasked with designing a mobile application to completely replace manual processes for staff check-in/out and streamline payroll workflows, including base pay, overtime, allowances, and deductions. As development progressed, I expanded the app to support auxiliary features such as leave, off-day, and claim submissions. Recognizing the need for operational oversight, I later built an admin version of the app for supervisors to review and manage staff requests. Additionally, I introduced a project management module to help coordinate manpower assignments for events â€” providing visibility into ongoing projects and task allocations.

            Many of our workers were older and from overseas, so I prioritized accessibility and simplicity. I designed a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring key tasks like check-in, claims, and payslip access were just one or two taps away. Given our event-based nature, I also factored in irregular work hours and built a flexible, configurable pay calculation system. All wireframes and logic diagrams were presented to stakeholders via Figma for early feedback.

            Based on the company&apos;s preference to leverage Google&apos;s ecosystem, I used Firebase for authentication, cloud functions, and storage. For more complex relational data needs, I integrated Supabase (PostgreSQL) â€” enabling structured schemas and triggers. I made heavy use of Supabase RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and edge functions to shift complex calculations and business logic (e.g., payroll, request validation) to the backend. This approach kept the mobile app lightweight and performant, while ensuring centralized, secure processing of core operations.

            The central feature is a GPS-based check-in/out system paired with facial recognition. To prevent abuse, the app enforces a location radius and verifies face presence â€” though we kept rules slightly lenient to avoid worker discomfort. I also designed a three-tier request system (Pending â†’ Approved/Rejected) for claims, leave, and off-days. For payroll, I implemented logic to dynamically calculate monthly OT pay based on working days, weekends, and public holidays.

            One key challenge was presenting time-based data (e.g., shift start/end) compactly. I eventually drew inspiration from flight-tracking apps to visually represent time intervals. Another real-world case revealed a worker checking in without showing their face â€” prompting me to integrate facial detection, ensuring images had valid human faces before submission. These real-world test cases shaped app policies and improved overall system reliability.

            I conducted usability testing with actual workers to ensure the app was intuitive across all age groups. One issue discovered was oversized text on certain devices due to user font settings â€” breaking layouts. I updated my styles to dynamically respond to font scaling and screen dimensions. These hands-on tests helped surface and solve practical edge cases before launch.

            I used Expo for development and managed separate builds for Android and iOS. For Android, I distributed APKs directly, while iOS testing was done via development builds. I implemented an auto-update mechanism using version files stored on Google Cloud. The app checks these files on launch and prompts users to download a new version when needed. For iOS, I researched and implemented internal enterprise distribution using provisioning certificates â€” allowing the app to be installed without publishing to the App Store.

            I built a contact form that lets users reach out directly to the company via email. Upon submission, users receive a confirmation email to confirm their message was received. I used EmailJS for this integration, which kept things lightweight and serverless. This small feature adds a layer of professionalism and trust to the site. It also streamlined communication between users and the company.     </>

            The client wanted a concrete texture background to match the companyâ€™s branding. This introduced challenges in readability and visual contrast between sections. To address this, I used layered elements, strategic spacing, and motion to help users differentiate sections. Custom animations helped keep the homepage dynamic without overwhelming users. The result was a unique yet clean design that respected both aesthetics and usability.

            One major challenge was deciding how to implement the blog in a way that didnâ€™t overcomplicate the system. I initially considered JSON files or a custom backend, but these required too much technical effort for the team. Contentful provided a user-friendly solution that saved time and scaled well. Design-wise, I went through many iterations to balance brand identity with modern design principles. Each decision was influenced by how maintainable and intuitive the site needed to be.

    overview: "Nutriwise is a mobile app developed as part of my Final Year Project (FYP), aimed at tackling the critical need for active diabetes self-management. With no known cure for the condition, empowering users with the right tools is essential. The app enables users to log meals, monitor glucose levels, manage insulin intake, and stay connected with a supportive community. As Project Lead, I oversaw the UI/UX design, guided the development process, architected the backend database, and conducted in-depth user and market research to ensure the app was both effective and user-friendly."

            As team lead, I conducted <strong>extensive user research</strong> to understand the lived experience of diabeticsâ€”especially <strong>older adults</strong>, who represent over 90% of cases. I studied their <strong>daily management habits</strong>, technology comfort levels, and health literacy. I also reviewed <strong>existing diabetes apps</strong> to identify gaps and opportunities.
            <br /><br />
            This research shaped the projectâ€™s direction and ensured our solution was grounded in real-world needs.

            In addition to basic tracking, our app provides data-driven analysis that visualizes trends from both food and glucose logs, empowering users to make informed health decisions. Smart insulin dosing recommendations are offered based on meal data and glucose readings, helping users manage their condition effectively. Medication management is streamlined, allowing users to log insulin intake and receive timely medication reminders. Lastly, the app encourages community engagement, enabling users to connect with peers, share experiences, and discover local support groups and events to stay motivated.
